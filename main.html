        <p style=" padding-top: 40px; color: #f2f2f2;"> Servants placed within this class are agile and powerful melee warriors armed with swords. It is commonly assumed to be the best class overall, with high parameters in all categories. It also possesses the Riding Skill like the Rider class.</p>
      </div>
      <div style=" opacity: 60%; text-align: center;   width: 175px; float: left;  height: 600px; background: red; margin: 10px; color: #f2f2f2;font-size: large; "> Lancer Class
        <p style="padding-top: 40px; color: #f2f2f2;"> Servants placed within this class are very agile and skilled with long-range melee weapons, such as spears, lances, etc. </p>
      </div>
      <div style=" opacity: 60%; text-align: center;  width: 175px; float: left;  height: 600px; background: silver; margin: 10px; font-size: large;"> Archer Class
        <p style="padding-top: 40px;">Servants placed within this class are usually proficient with projectiles and can survive longer without a Master nearby, thanks to their special ability Independent Action; the strongest Archers can be difficult to control at times, in fact, due to their near-total independence from their "Masters".</p>
      </div>
      <div style=" opacity: 60%; text-align: center;  width: 175px; float: left;  height: 600px; background: green; margin: 10px; color: #f2f2f2; font-size: large; "> Rider Class
        <p style="padding-top: 40px; color: #f2f2f2;">Servants placed within this class place emphasis upon speed and powerful Noble Phantasms, which often include their mounts. Their special Skill is Riding, which allows them to fully utilize abilities of their mounts (which can range from simple horses to mechanical vehicles to divine or supernatural creatures).</p>
      </div>
      <div style=" opacity: 60%; text-align: center;  width: 175px; float: left;  height: 600px; background: purple; margin: 10px; color: #f2f2f2; font-size: large; "> Caster Class
        <p style="padding-top: 40px;color: #f2f2f2;">Servants placed within this class are adept in magecraft and have a special ability akin to a Reality Marble, called Territory Creation, which alters or creates space around them to enhance their sorcery.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="opacity: 60%; text-align: center;  width: 175px; float: left;  height: 600px; background: black; margin: 10px; color: #f2f2f2; font-size: large; "> Assassin Class
       <p style="padding-top: 40px; color: #f2f2f2;">Servants placed within this class are proficient in assassination and stealth. Within certain wars, only Hassan-i-Sabbah can be summoned due to the etymology of the word "Assassin" acting as a catalyst. The Assassins' special ability is Presence Concealment, which allows them to remain undetected. Offset by their stealth is their moderate combat skills.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="opacity: 60%; text-align: center;  width: 175px; float: left;  height: 600px; background: grey; margin: 10px; color: #f2f2f2; font-size: large; "> Beserker Class
       <p style="padding-top: 40px; color: #f2f2f2;">Servants placed within this class are always heroes who have gone berserk in their lifetime or fight recklessly. This trait allows them to use the special ability Mad Enhancement, which trades their consciousness (i.e. sanity) for a large power boost. Most Masters are incapable of controlling their Servant once Mad Enhancement has been activated.</p>

      <p style="color: #f2f2f2; text-align: center; padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; "  id="col1" class="collapse">Artoria Pendragon Class Name Saber is one of the main characters of Fate/Zero and one of the three main heroines of Fate/stay night.
                  
        She is the Saber-class Servant of Kiritsugu Emiya in the Fourth Holy Grail War and Shirou Emiya in the Fifth Holy Grail War.
                        
        She is the Servant of Norma Goodfellow (possessed by Manaka Sajyou) in the Labyrinth Holy Grail War of Fate/Labyrinth.
                        
        She is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Orders conflicts of Fate/Grand Order. Saber is a heroic warrior who is summoned by a teenager named Shirou Emiya to participate in a war between masters and servants who are fighting to accomplish their dreams using the mythical Holy Grail. Saber's relationship with the story's other characters depends on the player's decisions; she becomes a love interest to Shirou in the novel's first route and also serves as that route's servant protagonist, a supporting character in the second, and a villain called "Saber Alter" (セイバー・オルタ, Seibā Oruta) in the third route.
        
        Saber is an agile and mighty warrior who is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears emotionally cold but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. She is also present in the prequel light novel Fate/Zero, in which she is the servant of Shirou's guardian Kiritsugu Emiya during the previous Holy Grail War, and in the sequel Fate/hollow ataraxia.

      <p style="color: #f2f2f2; text-align: center; padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; "  id="col2" class="collapse">Medusa Class Name Rider is the Rider-class Servant of Sakura Matou in the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. Due to Sakura's unwillingness to participate as a Master, Shinji Matou is instead given control over Rider. She only truly acts as Sakura's Servant when their connection is revealed in the Heaven's Feel scenario. She is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Order conflicts of Fate/Grand Order. She is the servant of Sakura Matou during the fifth Holy Grail War, but she became her brother Shinji's servant due to Sakura's refusal to be an enemy of Shirou Emiya during the war.
      
        Rider is first seen scouting around Homurabara Gakuen. Rider is silent, sultry, and vigilant, never hesitating to shield her Master from harm. With Shinji incapable of lending any Prana to her, she is forced to seek alternative means to augment her abilities. To compensate for this weakened state, Rider employs covert battle tactics and takes full advantage of any territory around her. Her weapon of choice is a pair of long iron nails fastened to opposite ends a single chain, which she effectively thrusts from distances. Rider is a tall, dark, silent and gorgeous Servant controlled by Shinji Matou. Rider is always seen with a blindfold and very long hair. Unlike Shinji, she is a little amiable; in fact, she dislikes him and considers him to be a coward. She wields a very long chain in battle with spikes on the ends. These chains make sounds like slithering snakes. However, because Shinji is not a magus, he greatly holds back her true potential, making her one of the weakest Servants.
      
        Because she is so quiet and her Master is so difficult to deal with, she remains quite mysterious until the third route when she begins receiving more focus, which is also where her true identity, the Gorgon Medusa, is revealed.

His true identity is that of Shirou Emiya (衛宮 士郎, Emiya Shirō?) of an alternate timeline from that of Fate/stay night who made a contract with the world and became the Heroic Spirit EMIYA (エミヤ, ?). He acts as a Counter Guardian for the world as payment for the contract. He is summoned because he still has the jewel pendant that Rin used to save his life after Lancer stabbed his heart. The jewel he owns is the actual catalyst used for his summoning rather than the one that Rin still has at the time of his summoning. After the end of each of the three routes in Fate/stay night, the possibility for Shirou to become Archer still exists, but the chance of it happening is close to zero.[3] Shirou Emiya won the Holy Grail War along with his Servant Saber, eventually going on to work as a freelance magus to pursue his dream of becoming an Ally of Justice. He stubbornly trained himself while pursuing his dream of saving mankind, but later fell into despair upon realizing that his abilities were insufficient in fulfilling his goal. Sometime in his twenties, he received his signature red overcoat as a gift from Ciel of the Church. He at some point encountered and fought beings similar to Angra Mainyu, but he was forced to retreat when he was unable to act against them. He later gained some understanding of such beings as targets of the Counter Force upon entering the Throne of Heroes.

    <p style="color: #f2f2f2; text-align: center; "  id="col" class="collapse">Artoria Pendragon Class Name Saber is one of the main characters of Fate/Zero and one of the three main heroines of Fate/stay night.
                
      She is the Saber-class Servant of Kiritsugu Emiya in the Fourth Holy Grail War and Shirou Emiya in the Fifth Holy Grail War.
                      
      She is the Servant of Norma Goodfellow (possessed by Manaka Sajyou) in the Labyrinth Holy Grail War of Fate/Labyrinth.
                      
      She is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Orders conflicts of Fate/Grand Order. Saber is a heroic warrior who is summoned by a teenager named Shirou Emiya to participate in a war between masters and servants who are fighting to accomplish their dreams using the mythical Holy Grail. Saber's relationship with the story's other characters depends on the player's decisions; she becomes a love interest to Shirou in the novel's first route and also serves as that route's servant protagonist, a supporting character in the second, and a villain called "Saber Alter" (セイバー・オルタ, Seibā Oruta) in the third route.
      
      Saber is an agile and mighty warrior who is loyal, independent, and reserved; she appears emotionally cold but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. She is also present in the prequel light novel Fate/Zero, in which she is the servant of Shirou's guardian Kiritsugu Emiya during the previous Holy Grail War, and in the sequel Fate/hollow ataraxia.

    <p style="color: #f2f2f2; text-align: center; padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; "  id="col1" class="collapse">Medusa Class Name Rider is the Rider-class Servant of Sakura Matou in the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. Due to Sakura's unwillingness to participate as a Master, Shinji Matou is instead given control over Rider. She only truly acts as Sakura's Servant when their connection is revealed in the Heaven's Feel scenario. She is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Order conflicts of Fate/Grand Order. She is the servant of Sakura Matou during the fifth Holy Grail War, but she became her brother Shinji's servant due to Sakura's refusal to be an enemy of Shirou Emiya during the war.
    
      Rider is first seen scouting around Homurabara Gakuen. Rider is silent, sultry, and vigilant, never hesitating to shield her Master from harm. With Shinji incapable of lending any Prana to her, she is forced to seek alternative means to augment her abilities. To compensate for this weakened state, Rider employs covert battle tactics and takes full advantage of any territory around her. Her weapon of choice is a pair of long iron nails fastened to opposite ends a single chain, which she effectively thrusts from distances. Rider is a tall, dark, silent and gorgeous Servant controlled by Shinji Matou. Rider is always seen with a blindfold and very long hair. Unlike Shinji, she is a little amiable; in fact, she dislikes him and considers him to be a coward. She wields a very long chain in battle with spikes on the ends. These chains make sounds like slithering snakes. However, because Shinji is not a magus, he greatly holds back her true potential, making her one of the weakest Servants.
    
      Because she is so quiet and her Master is so difficult to deal with, she remains quite mysterious until the third route when she begins receiving more focus, which is also where her true identity, the Gorgon Medusa, is revealed.
